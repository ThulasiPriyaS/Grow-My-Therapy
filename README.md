# Grow My Therapy - Website

A modern, responsive therapy website built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## üìã Project Context

This project was built as part of the internship selection process for Grow My Therapy. The task involved creating a responsive, therapist-focused website for a fictional psychologist, Dr. Serena Blake, using Next.js 14 and Tailwind CSS.

Although this was my first time working with Next.js, my background in React.js made the transition smooth. I followed a 7-hour tutorial to grasp Next.js fundamentals and relied on that learning to structure and build the application effectively.

The design is closely based on one of the two reference websites provided, as required. I ensured that the layout, typography, spacing, and overall look resembled the chosen reference site with about 65% design accuracy. For added functionality, cleaner styling, and better content tone, I used AI tools like ChatGPT ‚Äî but I made sure to personally review and refine all output, maintaining alignment with the expected design and quality standards.
